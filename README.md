# W.I.P.
trying to recreate the cpu from http://simplecpudesign.com/simple_cpu_v1/index.html in the cmd


ALU finally works!!! (use the Simple Alu Testing script to test it)

it wont be very fast tho..................

it mostly will be variables and if statements


project still is being made, will take some time...
